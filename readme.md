## Introduction
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers and improve their services. This project leverages deep learning models to predict churn based on historical customer data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes customer information such as demographics, account details, and usage patterns. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
```bash
streamlit run app.py
``` 

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and visualizations are provided in the jupyter notebook file.
